======

For quick start follow the instructions below. For more in dept info on why and how we build this AirRivet stuff you are more then welcome on the [wiki](https://github.com/icapps/ios-air-rivet/wiki)

## Concept
__AirRivet__ is a service layer build in Swift by using generics. The idea is that you have `Air` which is a class that performs the request for an `Environment`. To do this it needs a Type called `Rivet` that can be handeled over the `Air` ðŸ¤”. So how do we make this `Rivet` Type?

`AnyThing` can be a `Rivet` if they are `Rivetable`. `Rivetable` is a combination of protocols that the Rivet (Type) has to conform to. The `Rivet` is `Rivetable` if:

- `Mitigatable` -> Receive requests to make anything that can go wrong less severe.
- `Parsable` -> You get Dictionaries that you use to set the variables
- `EnvironmentConfigurable` -> We could get the data over the `Air` from a _production_ or a _development_ environment
	- There is also a special case where the environment is `Mockable` then your request are loaded from local files _(dummy files)_
- `UniqueAble` -> If your `AnyThing` is in a _collection_ you can find your entitiy by complying to `UniqueAble`

If you do the above (there are default implementation provided in the example). Then you could use the code like below.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

1. Create a Model object that complies to protocol `BaseModel`
2. Create a class that complies to `Environment`
3. Do a request like:

### Swift
```swift
class Foo: Rivetable {
	//Implement protocols -> See GameScore class in Example project.
}

import AirRivet

do {
	try Air.retrieve({ (response : Foo) in
	print(response)
})
}catch {
	print("ðŸ’£Error with request construction: \(error)ðŸ’£")
}
```
### Objective-C
We use generics so you cannot directly use AirRivet in Objective-C. You can bypass this by writing a wrapper. In our Example `GameScoreController`.

```objective-C
/**
 In build settings look at the Module Identifier. This is the one you should use to import swift files from the same target.
 */
#import "AirRivet_Example-Swift.h"

GameScoreController * controller = [[GameScoreController alloc] init];

[controller retrieve:^(NSArray<Foo *> * _Nonnull response) {
	NSLog(@"%@", response);
} failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
	NSLog(@"%@", error);
}];

@end
```
> *See "(project root)/Example" *

### Documentation

* Of the example can be found in [(project root)/Example/docs](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/icapps/ios-air-rivet/blob/master/Example/docs/index.html)
* Of the AirRivet pod in [(project root)/Example/Pods/docs](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/icapps/ios-air-rivet/blob/master/Example/Pods/docs/index.html)

## Requirements

iOS 8 or higher
Because we use generics you can only use this pod in Swift only files. You can mix and Match with Objective-C but not with generic classes.

## Installation

AirRivet is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "AirRivet"
```
