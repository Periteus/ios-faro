======

For a quick start follow the instructions below. For more in depth information on why and how we build Faro, the [wiki](https://github.com/icapps/ios-faro/wiki) page.

## Concept

__Faro__ is a service layer build in Swift using generics.

The idea is that you have `Air` which is a class that performs the request for an `Environment`. To do this it needs a Type called `Rivet` that can be handled over the `Air` ðŸ¤”. So how do we make this `Rivet` Type?

`AnyThing` can be a `Rivet` if they are `Rivetable`. `Rivetable` is a combination of protocols that the Rivet (Type) has to conform to. The `Rivet` is `Rivetable` if:

- `Mitigatable`: Receive requests to make anything that can go wrong less severe. `Faro` includes 2 `Mitigator`:

	1. `MitigatorDefault` prints any error that is thrown
	2. `MitigatorNoPrinting` does not print anyting. Handy for testing!

- `Parsable`: You get Dictionaries that you use to set the variables.
- `EnvironmentConfigurable`: We could get the data over the `Air` from a _production_ or a _development_ environment.
- `Mockable`: There is also a special case where the environment can be mocked. Than your request are loaded from local files _(dummy files)_
- `UniqueAble`: If your `AnyThing` is in a _collection_ you can find your entity by complying to `UniqueAble`
- `Transformable`: We need to be able to _transform_ data to a `Rivetable` type. A default transformer is `TransformJSON` but you can provide your own. Faro include 3 transformers you could use:

	1. `TransformJSON` the default
	2. `TransfromCoreData` -> used to transform to core data object.
	3. `TransformAndStore` -> use to store a JSON file when fetching
	4. `TransformAndStoreCoreData` -> equal to 3 but for CoreData


If you do the above (there are default implementation provided in the example). Then you could use the code like below.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

1. Create a generic class that complies to `Environment, Mockable`.
2. Create a Model object that complies to protocol `Rivetable`.

### Swift
#### 1. Environment
```swift
class Environment <Rivet: EnvironmentConfigurable>: Environment, Mockable  {
	//You should use the contextPath as your API works. For this Environment we have "<base>/contextPath"
	var serverUrl = "http:// ...\(Rivet().contextPath())"
	var request: NSMutableURLRequest

	init() {
		request = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: NSURL(string: serverUrl)!)
	}

	func shouldMock() -> Bool {
		return false
	}
}
```
#### 2. Rivetable
```swift
class Foo: Rivetable {
	// Implement protocols.
	// See GameScore class in Example project.
}

import Faro

do {
	try Air.retrieve({ (response : Foo) in
	  print(response)
  })
} catch {
	print("ðŸ’£Error with request construction: \(error)ðŸ’£")
}
```

#### 3. Mitigatable
Use this to change the default error handling. Default handling is:
1. `Print` the error
2. `throw` the error back up

```swift
class Foo: Foo {
	// Implement protocols.
	// See GameScore class in Example project.

	class override func responseMitigator() -> protocol<ResponseMitigatable, Mitigator> {
		return MitigatorDefault()
	}

	class override func requestMitigator() -> protocol<RequestMitigatable, Mitigator> {
		return MitigatorDefault()
	}
}
```
If you want different error handling you can provide a different Mititagor instance.
As an example we provide the `MitigatorNoPrinting`. Handy to use in Unit tests

```swift
class MockFoo: Foo {
	// Implement protocols.
	// See GameScore class in Example project.

	// Override to disable printing

	class override func responseMitigator() -> protocol<ResponseMitigatable, Mitigator> {
		return MitigatorNoPrinting()
	}

	class override func requestMitigator() -> protocol<RequestMitigatable, Mitigator> {
		return MitigatorNoPrinting()
	}
}
```
### Objective-C

We use generics so you cannot directly use Faro in Objective-C. You can bypass this by writing a wrapper.

In our Example `GameScoreController` is the wrapper class.

```objective-C
// In build settings look at the Module Identifier.
// This is the one you should use to import swift files from the same target.

#import "Faro_Example-Swift.h"

GameScoreController * controller = [[GameScoreController alloc] init];
[controller retrieve:^(NSArray<Foo *> * _Nonnull response) {
	NSLog(@"%@", response);
} failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
	NSLog(@"%@", error);
}];
```
> *See "(project root)/Example"*

## Unit tests
Faro provides a way to mock data when writing unit tests.
### Rivetable enum/ struct / class

Mock the enviroment you use with `Air`. This you can do in 2 steps
1. using a `MockEnvironment` like below.
2. Subclasses the rivetable instance

```swift
class MockEnvironment<Rivet: EnvironmentConfigurable>: ApplictionEnvironment <Rivet> {
	override class shouldMock () {
		return true
	}
}
```

```swift

class MockFoo: Foo {
	override class func environment() -> protocol<Environment, Mockable> {
		return MockEnvironment<MockFoo>()
	}

	override class func transform() -> TransformJSON {
		return TransformJSON()
	}
}
```


### Core Data entities
Writing unit tests with Core Data can be hard. With Faro you can write unit test for CoreData but it is still combursome.
Do the stepps like above but make sure to provide the managedObjectContext for unit tests. See `CoreDataUnitTests`.
Make sure you create a singleton for your `CoreDataUnitTests` instance.

```swift
class MockCoreDataEntity: CoreDataEntity {
	override class func environment() -> protocol<Environment, Mockable> {
		return MockEnvironment<MockCoreDataEntity>()
	}

	override class func transform() -> TransformJSON {
		return TransformJSON()
	}
	override class func managedObjectContext() -> NSManagedObjectContext?  {
		return coredataUnitTests.sharedInstance.managedObjectContext
	}
}
```

## Write unit tests
In the example project you can find examples written with `Nimbel` for both CoreData and others.

## Requirements

- iOS 8 or higher
- Because we use generics you can only use this pod in Swift only files. You can mix and Match with Objective-C but not with generic classes.

## Installation

Faro is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

To install it with CocoaPods, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Faro"
```
