# Umbrella
A first step towards a generic webService framework made in swift. Any feedback welcome!

## Use of playground
The project includes a playground that lets you:
* Setup the Service Objects
  * Request controller
  * Adaptor
* GET something
* PUT something
* play around

### QuickStart:
* clone this repo
* go to folder en open **workspace** > *UmbrellaWorkspace.xcworkspace*
  * Be sure to upon the workspace and not the playground. The import Umbrella will not work then.
* There is an Umbrella project in the workspace. Run it first once!
* The go to the playground. I should work now
