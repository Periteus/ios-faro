# Umbrella
A first step towards a generic webService framework made in swift. Any feedback welcome!

### QuickStart:
* clone this repo
* go to folder en open **workspace** > *UmbrellaWorkspace.xcworkspace*
  * Be sure to upon the workspace and not the playground. The import Umbrella will not work then.
* There is an Umbrella project in the workspace. Run it first once!
* The go to the playground. I should work now
* Also have a look at the unit tests to see how it all works.
