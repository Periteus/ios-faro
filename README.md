# Umbrella
A first step towards a generic webService framework made in swift. Any feedback welcome!
This is a first start and not realy finished. Use this to learn and give comments about: 
1. What are generics?
2. Webservice stack
3. Saving
4. Retreiving
5. Error handling
6. TODO:#7 Dummy service
7. TODO:#8 Mapping
8. TODO:#9 Use with Objective-C

### QuickStart:
* clone this repo
* go to folder en open **workspace** > *UmbrellaWorkspace.xcworkspace*
  * Be sure to upon the workspace and not the playground. The import Umbrella will not work then.
* There is an Umbrella project in the workspace. Run it first once!
* The go to the playground. I should work now
* Also have a look at the unit tests to see how it all works.
